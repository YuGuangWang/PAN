## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training and Evaluation

To train and test the model(s) in the paper, run the following command. We provide the codes for PAN on three benchmarks in Table 1 and the new dataset PointPattern. The dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed before training. The running environment is recommended in a GPU server.

PAN on Graph classification benchmark datasets; dataname to be replaced by PROTEINS, PROTEINSF, NCI1, AIDS, MUTAGEN
```
python pan_benchmark.py --dataname --L 3 --runs 10
```
PAN on PointPattern classification task
```
python pan_pointpattern.py --phi 0.3 --L 4 --runs 10
```
Other hyperparameters: --batch_size, --learning_rate, --weight_decay, --pool_ratio, --nhid, --epochs

## Results

Our model PAN achieves the following performance on graph classification benchmark datasets MUTAG, PROTEINSF and NCI1, and our new graph classification dataset PointPattern (with phi=0.35). The table below shows the mean test accuracy with SD for 10 repetitions. Compared to existing methods such as GCNConv+TopKPool, SAGEConv+SAGPool, GATConv+EdgePool, with the same network architecture, the PAN achieves top test accuracy on most of these datasets. The results are obtained using the above .py programs. The test results on other benchmarks and comparison with the results of other methods can be seen in the paper.

> ðŸ“‹Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it. 

## New datasets
Our new datasets are for 3-classification task of point distribtuion graphs, stemming from statistical mechanics. Use following commands to download the three typical datasets we used in the paper:
```
import os
import zipfile
import gdown
phi = 0.3 # change to 0.35 or 0.4 for other two PointPattern datasets
if phi==0.3:
    ld_dir = 'hpr_phi03' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '/'
    url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1C3ciJsteqsKFVGF8JI8-KnXhe4zY41Ss'
    output = 'hpr_phi03' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '.zip'
if phi==0.4:
    ld_dir = 'hpr_phi04' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '/'
    url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rsTh09FzGxHculBVrYyl5tOHD9mxqc0G'
    output = 'hpr_phi04' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '.zip'
if phi==0.35:
    ld_dir = 'hpr_phi035' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '/'
    url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16pI974P8WzanBUPrMHIaGfeSLoksviBk'
    output = 'hpr_phi035' + '_' + str(num_graph) + '.zip'
if not os.path.exists(output):
    gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)
with zipfile.ZipFile(output, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall()
os.remove(output)
```
