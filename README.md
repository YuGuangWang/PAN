# Path Integral Based Convolution and Pooling for Graph Neural Networks

This repository is the official implementation of [Path Integral Based Convolution and Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/). 

> ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training and Evaluation

To train and test the model(s) in the paper, run the following command. We provide the codes for PAN on three benchmarks in Table 1 and the new dataset PointPattern. The dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed before training. The running environment is recommended in a GPU server.

### [PAN on Graph classification benchmark datasets; dataname to be replaced by PROTEINS, PROTEINSF, NCI1, AIDS, MUTAGEN]()
```
python pan_benchmark.py --dataname --L 3 --runs 10
```
### [PAN on PointPattern classification task]()
```
python pan_pointpattern.py --phi 0.3 --L 4 --runs 10
```
Other hyperparameters: --batch_size, --learning_rate, --weight_decay, --pool_ratio, --nhid, --epochs

## Results

Our model PAN achieves the following performance on graph classification benchmark datasets MUTAG, PROTEINSF and NCI1, and our new graph classification dataset PointPattern (with phi=0.35). The table below shows the mean test accuracy with SD for 10 repetitions. Compared to existing methods such as GCNConv+TopKPool, SAGEConv+SAGPool, GATConv+EdgePool, with the same network architecture, the PAN achieves top test accuracy on most of these datasets. The results are obtained using the above .py programs. The test results on other benchmarks and comparison with the results of other methods can be seen in the paper.
