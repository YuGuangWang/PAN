# Path Integral Based Convolution and Pooling for Graph Neural Networks

This repository is the official implementation of [Path Integral Based Convolution and Pooling for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/). 

> ðŸ“‹Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

## Training and Evaluation

To train and test the model(s) in the paper, run the following command. We provide the codes for PAN on three benchmarks in Table 1 and the new dataset PointPattern. The dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed before training. 

```PANConv+PANPool on MUTAG
python pan_mutag.py
```
```PANConv+PANPool on PROTEINSF
python pan_proteinsf.py
```
```PANConv+PANPool on NCI1
python pan_nci1.py
```

> ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.


> ðŸ“‹Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Results

Our model PAN achieves the following performance on graph classification benchmark datasets MUTAG, PROTEINSF and NCI1, and our new graph classification dataset PointPattern (with phi=0.35). Compared to existing methods such as GCN ... with the same network architecture, PAN achieves top test accuracy on all these datasets.
